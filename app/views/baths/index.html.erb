<p class="body">
  Smaller children run the risk of drowning if they fall headfirst into the
  toilet bowl. Injuries to adults include bruised buttocks, tail bones, and
  dislocated hips from unsuspectingly sitting on the toilet bowl rim because the
  seat is up or loose. Injuries can also be caused by pinching due to splits in
  plastic seats or by splinters from wooden seats, or if the toilet itself
  collapses under the weight of the user. Older high tank cast iron cisterns
  have been known to detach from the wall when the chain is pulled to flush,
  causing injuries to the user.

  Toilet related injuries are also surprisingly common, with some estimates
  ranging up to 40,000 injuries in the US every year. In 2012, 2.3 million
  toilets in the United States, and about 9,400 in Canada, were recalled due to faulty
  pressure-assist flush mechanisms which put users at risk of the fixture
  exploding.
