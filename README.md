UrineLuck

We will be attempting to solve a problem nearly every person has faced in their life one time or another. UrineLuck is a web application that helps users locate clean, public bathroom’s while they are out and about. Users of the app will give their current location and the app will locate public bathroom’s in their immediate area and will feature a rating out of 5 stars on each bathroom. Users also are given the option to browse our CrapMap™ and plan they’re conquest in advance so they do not find themselves prairie dogging while they are shopping with friends or lawn bowling at the park. The customer will also see a list of reviews and ratings left by us or other users who have visited the bathroom and wish to inform others of their experiences using said bathroom. Currently we plan to make use of Google Maps API for the geographical components and Yelp API for the review components. 

If time permits we may attempt to develop the app for mobile devices and also add a basic game to the app so people may occupy themselves while “taking care of business”. Users will also be able to upload images of the bathroom location. We encourge selfies.

We will have two types of users Admin and Normal users. Normal users can request to add bathrooms and also report bathrooms (although these reports will likely stay hidden). Admin users will be able to add bathrooms and also remove them (Admins will be able to see reports). We are also considering adding genders to each type of user.
